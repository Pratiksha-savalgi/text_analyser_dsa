# Text Analyser – Java DSA Project

## 📌 Overview
Text Analyser is a Java-based project that applies **core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts to real-world text processing problems.  
The project includes both **backend logic** and a **simple graphical user interface**, allowing users to interactively analyze text.

This project focuses on correctness, efficiency, and practical use of DSA rather than isolated problem-solving.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Text Normalization
- Converts text to lowercase (locale-safe)
- Removes punctuation
- Eliminates extra whitespace  
This ensures consistent and reliable text processing.

### 2. Word Frequency Counter
- Calculates frequency of each word using `HashMap`
- Demonstrates hashing and counting techniques

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Uses **sliding window technique**
- Efficient O(n) solution with `HashSet`

### 4. Anagram Checker
- Normalizes input strings
- Compares character frequency maps
- Demonstrates hash-based comparison

### 5. Top-K Frequent Words
- Uses `HashMap` + `PriorityQueue (Min Heap)`
- Efficiently extracts the top K most frequent words

### 6. Simple GUI
- Popup-based interface
- Allows users to select operations and input text
- Built using Java Swing
